## Sol System 3D

This app is a 3D visualizer of celestial bodies in our solar system. Their position data is fetched from the Miriade API of the Paris Institute of Celestial Mechanics and Ephemeride Calculations.

The app uses the three, react-three-fiber, drei and react-transition-group for rendering the 3D scene and elements and for animating the UI elements.
